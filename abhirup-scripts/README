How to run:
1. Run in console: Uncomment the last three lines in infnet_main.py. and run the file.
                   - To generate the pickle files from the csv files, you need to run some of the helper functions in the same file.
                   - Install networkx 2.1
                   - To get the collaboration graph plot graphviz needs to be installed. I faced some glitch while setting this up. Installed various things from the internet search and now I'm not sure which one actually solved the issue.

2. Run as a webservice: a. Install bottle(https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)
                        b. Change the hostname to your ip address in the last line in bottle_interface.py
                        c. Run bottle_interface.py
                        d. Open web browser and open the url specified in the console.

Setup:

If using (mini)conda/Virtual environment:
1. create new environment: `conda create -n infnet2 python=2`
2. Activate the environment: `source activate infnet2`
3. Install required packages: `conda env update --file environment.yml'
(Tested on my ubuntu 16.04)
