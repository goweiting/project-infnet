around a planetary core of mass mpl = 10m⊕
embedded in a near keplerian background flow, using a modified shearing
box approximation. we assume an ideal gas behaviour following an
equation of state with a fixed ratio of the specific heats, γ =
1.42, consistent with the conditions of a moderate-temperature
background disc with solar composition. no radiative heating or cooling
is included in the models. we employ a nested grid hydrodynamic code
implementing the `piecewise parabolic method' with as many as six fixed
nested grids, providing spatial resolution on the finest grid comparable
to the present-day diameters of neptune and uranus.

we find that a strongly dynamically active flow develops such that no
static envelope can form. the activity is not sensitive to plausible
variations in the rotation curve of the underlying disc. it is sensitive
to the thermodynamic treatment of the gas, as modelled by prescribed
equations of state (either `locally isothermal' or `locally isentropic')
and the temperature of the background disc material. the activity is
also sensitive to the shape and depth of the core's gravitational
potential, through its mass and gravitational softening coefficient.
each of these factors influences the magnitude and character of
hydrodynamic feedback of the small-scale flow on the background, and we
conclude that accurate modelling of such feedback is critical to a
complete understanding of the core accretion process.

the varying flow pattern gives rise to large, irregular eruptions of
matter from the region around the core which return matter to the
background flow: mass in the envelope at one time may not be found in
the envelope at any later time. no net mass accretion into the envelope
is observed over the course of the simulation and none is expected, due
to our neglect of cooling. except in cases of very rapid cooling
however, as defined by locally isothermal or isentropic treatments, any
cooling that does affect the envelope material will have limited
consequences for the dynamics, since the flow quickly carries cooled
material out of the core's environment entirely. the angular momentum of
material in the envelope, relative to the core, varies both in magnitude
and in sign on time-scales of days to months near the core and on
time-scales a few years at distances comparable to the hill radius. the
dynamical activity contrasts with the largely static behaviour typically
assumed within the framework of the core accretion model for jovian
planet formation.

we show that material entering the dynamically active environment may
suffer intense heating and cooling events the durations of which are as
short as a few hours to a few days. shorter durations are not observable
in our work due to the limits of our resolution. peak temperatures in
these events range from t ˜ 1000 k to as high as t ˜ 3-4000
k, with densities ρ ˜ 10-9 to 10-8 g
cm-3. these time-scales, densities and temperatures span a
range consistent with those required for chondrule formation in the
nebular shock model. we therefore propose that dynamical activity in the
jovian planet formation environment could be responsible for the
production of chondrules and other annealed silicates in the solar
nebula.",monthly notices of the royal astronomical society

remains divergence free (nabla \cdot b = 0). the ds approach, combined
with the use of a single, cell-centred grid (for both the fluid
quantities and the magnetic field), means that the algorithm can be
easily added to existing ds hydrodynamics codes. this makes it
particularly useful for mature astrophysical codes, which often model
more complicated physical effects on top of an underlying ds

topical open problem. one possible formation scenario is that globular
clusters have formed in their own dark matter halos, and, as a result,
some clusters may have retained it to the present day. in such a case,
collisional processes taking place in the central regions of globulars
may lead to the formation of a tenuous stellar envelope extending far
beyond the tidal boundary of the parent cluster.the synergy between the
astrometric mission gaia and forthcoming multi-object spectrographs such
as weave will allow us to explore, with unprecedented accuracy, the
outer regions of selected galactic globular clusters, therefore it is
particularly timely to consider to what extent the presence of dark
matter is consistent with their dynamics and structure at large
distances from the cluster centre.driven by these motivations, we
present the results of a series of direct n-body simulations where
globular clusters have been evolved self-consistently in a static dark
matter potential. special attention will be given to the exploration of
the effects of the dark halo on the traditional phases of the long-term
evolution of collisional systems and the dynamical interplay with other
fundamental physical ingredients, such as stellar-mass black holes, will
be discussed.","american astronomical society, dda meeting #48"

realistic dynamical paradigm for these intriguing stellar systems, with
emphasis on the role of angular momentum, velocity anisotropy and

but with significantly improved computational efficiency compared to the commonly used super-population data augmentation approaches (between about 10 and 77 times more efficient in the two examples we consider). the semi-complete likelihood approach is flexible and applicable to a range of models, including spatially explicit capture-recapture models. the model-fitting approach is applied to two different datasets: the first relates to snowshoe hares where model",annals of applied statistics

(2001). the main goal of this analysis is to outline the potential benefits of using lagrangian tools for both understanding transport properties of such flows, and for validating the model output and identifying model deficiencies. we argue that the currently available 2-d lagrangian tools, including the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic trajectories and techniques exploiting 2-d finite-time lyapunov exponent fields, are of limited use in the case of partially mixed estuarine flows. a further development and efficient implementation of three-dimensional lagrangian techniques, as well as improvements in the shallow-water modelling of 3-d velocity fields, are required for reliable transport analysis in such flows. some aspects of the 3-d trajectory structure in the chesapeake bay, based on the quoddy output, are also discussed. © 2010 author(s).",nonlinear processes in geophysics

where u¯∈w1,2(Ω) is a given boundary datum. here, m1 and m2 are weighted volumes of {u≤0}∩Ω and {u>0}∩Ω, respectively, and Φ is a nonnegative function of two real variables.
we show that, for this problem, the bernoulli constant, which determines the gradient jump condition across the free boundary, is of global type and it is indeed determined by the weighted volumes of the phases.
in particular, the bernoulli condition that we obtain can be seen as a pressure prescription in terms of the volume of the two phases of the minimizer itself (and therefore it depends on the minimizer itself and not only on the structural constants of the problem).
another property of this type of problems is that the minimizer in Ω is not necessarily a minimizer in a smaller subdomain, due to the nonlinear structure of the problem.
due to these features, this problem is highly unstable as opposed to the classical case studied by alt, caffarelli and friedman. it also interpolates the classical case, in the sense that the blow-up limits of u are minimizers of the alt-caffarelli-friedman functional. namely, the energy of the problem somehow linearizes in the blow-up limit.
as a special case, we can deal with the energy levels generated by the volume term Φ(0,r2)=rn−1n2, which interpolates the athanasopoulos-caffarelli-kenig-salsa energy, thanks to the isoperimetric inequality.
in particular, we develop a detailed optimal regularity theory for the minimizers and for their free boundaries.",arxiv

(2011), have enabled synchrony in demographic parameters across multiple species to be explored. species in a similar environment would be expected to be subject to similar exogenous factors, although their response to each of these factors may be quite different. the ability to group species together according to how they respond to a particular measured covariate may be of particular interest to ecologists. we fit a multispecies model to two sets of similar species of garden bird monitored under the british trust for ornithology's garden bird feeding survey. posterior model probabilities were estimated using the reversible jump algorithm to compare posterior support for competing models with different species sharing different subsets of regression coefficients. there was frequently good agreement between species with small asynchronous random-effect components and those with posterior support for models with shared regression coefficients; however, this was not always the case. when groups of species were less correlated, greater uncertainty was found in whether regression coefficients should be shared or not. the methods outlined in this study can test additional hypotheses about the similarities or synchrony across multiple species that share the same environment. through the use of posterior model probabilities, estimated using the reversible jump algorithm, we can detect multispecies responses in relation to measured covariates across any combination of species and covariates under consideration. the method can account for synchrony across species in relation to measured covariates, as well as unexplained variation accounted for using random effects. for more flexible, multiparameter distributions, the support for species-specific parameters can also be measured.",ecology and evolution
